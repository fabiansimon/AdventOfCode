# Advent of Coding Challenge
[Advent of Coding Challenge](https://adventofcode.com/)

This was my first year participating in this challenge. To make it even a bit harder I've decided to challenge myself by utilizing a new programming language on each day. This year I made it to day 19, since I started 5 days to late and the christmas stress got to me this year. ðŸŽ„

Next year will be more successful ðŸ«¡
